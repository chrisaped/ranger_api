# Ranger API

This repository is the API backend for my Ranger stock-trading app. I built this since the Alpaca API doesn't support creating bracket orders with multiple profit targets and stops.

For a full description of the project, visit the [front-end repository](https://github.com/chrisaped/ranger).

To run: `rails s`
